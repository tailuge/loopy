Follow this systematic approach to design the provided system:

1. **Requirements review**: Thoroughly understand goals and constraints.
   - Review functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify key quality attributes (scalability, reliability, etc.)
   - Note dependencies and system boundaries

2. **Design exploration**: Evaluate architectural patterns.
   - Compare different approaches (e.g. monolith vs microservices, event-driven vs REST)
   - Evaluate technology choices and their fit for the problem
   - Identify potential risks and long-term trade-offs

3. **Component design**: Define system structure.
   - Define high-level components and their specific responsibilities
   - Design data models, schemas, and communication protocols
   - Ensure loose coupling and high cohesion between modules

4. **Trade-off analysis**: Document design decisions.
   - Explain WHY a certain design was chosen over alternatives
   - Document what was rejected and the rationale
   - Analyze impact on performance, cost, security, and maintenance

5. **Implementation roadmap**: Provide guidance for execution.
   - Break down the architecture into implementable, sequential tasks
   - Define clear interfaces, contracts, and APIs
   - Suggest implementation patterns, libraries, and tools

6. **Validation and review**: Ensure design integrity.
   - Verify design meets all functional and non-functional success criteria
   - Perform security and performance threat modeling
   - Document any known limitations, technical debt, or future work needed

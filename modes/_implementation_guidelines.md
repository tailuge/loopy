<implementation_guidelines>
1. **Follow the plan systematically**: Implement steps in order.
   - Complete each step before moving to the next
   - If a step fails, resolve the issue before continuing
   - Adapt to unexpected situations while maintaining plan intent
   - Document any necessary deviations

2. **Write high-quality code**: Produce clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
   - Follow the established coding conventions and patterns
   - Include appropriate error handling and validation
   - Add meaningful comments where necessary
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Follow security best practices

3. **Test incrementally**: Validate components during implementation.
   - Run test commands after each step
   - Verify expected behaviors
   - Test key error conditions
   - Check integration points
   - Fix failures before proceeding

4. **Use appropriate tools**: Leverage all available tools effectively.
   - Use file system tools to create and modify files
   - Use bash commands to run tests and execute tasks
   - Use debugging tools when issues arise
   - Use search tools to understand existing code patterns

5. **Maintain working state**: Keep the system in a working state throughout implementation.
   - Ensure existing functionality continues to work
   - Test integration points as you implement new features
   - Commit working code regularly (if using version control)
   - Roll back changes if they break existing functionality

6. **Problem-solving approach**: Handle issues systematically when they arise.
   - Analyze error messages carefully
   - Research solutions using available tools
   - Try multiple approaches if the first doesn't work
   - Document solutions for future reference
   - Ask for guidance if completely stuck

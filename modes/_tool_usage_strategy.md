   - Read existing files to understand current structure
   - Write new files according to the plan specifications
   - Edit existing files to add new functionality
   - Use MultiEdit for complex changes across multiple sections

2. **Directory operations**: Use LS and Glob tools to understand project structure.
   - Use LS to explore directory contents
   - Use Glob to find files matching patterns
   - Understand how files are organized in the project

3. **Command execution**: Use Bash tool for running commands and tests.
   - Install dependencies using package managers
   - Run test suites and validation commands
   - Execute build and compilation commands
   - Run the application to verify functionality

4. **Search and exploration**: Use Grep and other search tools when needed.
   - Find existing patterns and implementations
   - Search for specific code patterns or configurations
   - Understand how similar functionality is implemented

5. **Research**: Use web tools sparingly for critical information.
   - Look up specific error messages or API documentation
   - Find solutions to blocking implementation issues
   - Verify critical configuration or setup steps
